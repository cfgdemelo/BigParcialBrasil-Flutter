Application created to show votes intention about "Big Brother Brasil" reality show, where users could access and demonstrate in which reality show competitor would they vote.

Everything presented on the screen comes from a Firebase Realtime Database, including texts, photos, votes options and so on.

This sample application was created to test some technologies such as:

- Flutter
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Loading images from url with Flutter
- Creating and removing Flutter elements on the fly
- Creating a simple row chart using only Flutter based on number of "votes" returning from Firebase
- Play Store publication (wip)
